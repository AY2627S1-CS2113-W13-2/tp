### Adding a deposit or withdrawal

The `deposit` and `withdraw` commands record money coming in and going out. Each one creates a
`Transaction` and adds it to the `TransactionList`, which is the single place where all
transactions are stored and where the balance is calculated.

#### Classes involved

* `Parser` turns the text typed by the user into a command object, and rejects invalid input by
  throwing a `FinNusException`.
* `DepositCommand` and `WithdrawCommand` are subclasses of the abstract `Command` class. Each
  overrides `execute(TransactionList, Ui)`.
* `Transaction` is an immutable record of one money movement. It stores a `TransactionType`
  (`DEPOSIT` or `WITHDRAWAL`), a positive `BigDecimal` amount and a description.
* `TransactionList` holds all transactions in the order they were added.

#### How a withdrawal is processed

Given below is what happens when the user enters `withdraw 4.50 d/Lunch`.

1. `FinNUS#run()` reads the line through `Ui` and passes it to `Parser#parse()`.
2. `Parser#parse()` reads the command word `withdraw` and calls `parseWithdraw("4.50 d/Lunch")`.
3. `splitAmountAndDescription()` splits the arguments into the amount `"4.50"` and the
   description `"Lunch"`. The `d/` prefix only counts when it starts a word, so text such as
   `and/or` inside a description is not mistaken for a prefix. The amount and `d/DESCRIPTION`
   may be given in either order, e.g. `withdraw d/Lunch 4.50`.
4. `parseAmount()` checks the amount and converts it to a `BigDecimal`. For a withdrawal,
   `parseWithdraw()` also checks that the description is not empty.
5. The parser returns a new `WithdrawCommand(4.50, "Lunch")`.
6. `FinNUS` calls `execute()`, which creates a `Transaction` of type `WITHDRAWAL`, adds it to the
   `TransactionList` and shows a confirmation through `Ui`.

A deposit follows the same steps, except that the description is optional.

#### Validation rules

An amount is accepted only if it:

* matches `\d+(\.\d{1,2})?`, i.e. a plain number with at most 2 decimal places. This one
  check rejects inputs such as `-5`, `1e3`, `NaN`, `$5` and `4.555`;
* is greater than 0;
* is not more than `Parser.MAX_AMOUNT` (1,000,000), which catches typos such as extra zeros.

If any rule fails, the parser throws a `FinNusException`. The main loop catches it and shows the
message to the user, so invalid input never stops the app.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: how amounts are stored**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `BigDecimal`.
  * Pros: stores decimal amounts exactly, so the balance never drifts.
  * Cons: more verbose, e.g. `a.add(b)` instead of `a + b`, and `compareTo()` instead of `<`.
* **Alternative 2:** `double`.
  * Pros: simpler arithmetic.
  * Cons: most decimal values cannot be stored exactly (e.g. `0.1 + 0.2` gives
    `0.30000000000000004`), so balances would become slightly wrong over many transactions.

**Aspect: whether a withdrawal needs a description**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** a description is required for `withdraw` but optional for
  `deposit`.
  * Pros: users always know what they spent money on, which is the main purpose of tracking
    expenses. Most deposits are regular allowances, so a description adds little.
  * Cons: a withdrawal takes slightly longer to type.
* **Alternative 2:** the description is optional for both.
  * Pros: faster to type.
  * Cons: the transaction history becomes hard to understand later.
